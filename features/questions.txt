Next Steps:
figure out keyboard dismiss events 

1. figure out how to make a task details page
2. convert buttons to touchable opacity things 
3. figure out state --> probably use redux 
4. figure out normal form in react native 
5. get rid of date aspect and change to number created 
    another piece of state. 

Questions:
1. in the navigation --> how do I get my details page to know what task to pull the details on to edit it?
2. i had ot take out RenderList since the navigation function didn't seem to pass through there... would i have needed to add renderlist to my maincomponents <Stack Nav> function?
3. where does const {task} = route.params go?
STATE NEEDED:
1. updated task state
2. urgency state
3. status state. 

Layout:
    I think I want to make a button from home page to add a new task?
    Then they can add the task, and set the 2 tags on that page

    Change the formatt of the home page... buttons should be side by side.
    figure out how to organize based on timestamp.. if completed move to the bottom 

    have views to see completed and not?
